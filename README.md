## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

My Three favorite apps are
-Instagram
    1. Easy to share photos
    2. Easy video and voice calling
    3. Connects with others in contacts
-Discord
    1. Easy access to voice chats through groups
    2. Well integrated text chats with gifs and videos
-Real
    1. Organized stats by sports
    2. Can view team or individual stats
    
An app that I would like to create is a fitness app that tracks; calories burned, muscles targeted, and macros of foods. 
I have seen many apps that have these features seperately but I would like to accumulate them in one place for easy access.
This could help many people, such as my father and I, who track things such as calories or workout splits.
